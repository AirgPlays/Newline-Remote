## ⚖️ Educational Use & Responsibility Notice

This repository is provided strictly for **educational, research, and technical analysis purposes**.

The infrared files contained here are intended to support the study of IR communication protocols, signal structures, and hardware interaction using the Flipper Zero. This project exists to promote responsible experimentation and deeper technical understanding of infrared systems.

**Use only equipment that you personally own or have explicit authorization to test.**

Misuse, unauthorized device interaction, interference with property, or any form of “skidding” is not condoned or endorsed.

You assume full responsibility for how you use the information and files provided in this repository.

## 📘 Project Overview

This repository is dedicated to collecting and maintaining **Newline Infrared (IR) files** formatted for use with the **Flipper Zero**.

Its purpose is to:

- Document and preserve IR signal captures  
- Analyze protocol behavior and encoding methods  
- Support hands-on experimentation in controlled environments  
- Provide structured resources for learning and research  

Infrared protocols such as **NEC, RC5, RC6**, and related standards may be represented for structured technical exploration.
